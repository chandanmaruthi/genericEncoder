# genericEncoder
Simple generic encoder for encoding english text



This encoder tries to capture the Topology of ASCII text.
There is quite a lot of hand coding of features. So there is significant room for improvement
My objective here was to show how a topological encoding of ASCII words can be used as a fault tolerant encoding system


Thought Process:

Key Features of words encoded are
- First charecter
- Last charecter
- Tall Charectors
- Distance between the charectors
